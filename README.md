IMAGE SPACE

## Description 

This project has taken Horiseon's exisiting website HTML and CSS and has altered it to be more accessible, without changing the appearance of the website. Horiseon have asked for this to be done because accessibility is a very important topic and it's crucial that their website is as accessibile as possible, making it inclusive for all users and making it accessible for screen readers. The end result was achieved my altering Horiseon's website HTML to only contain semantic HTML elements, getting rid of unecessary code and by adding alt descriptions to all images and icons. The CSS was reorganised and edited in conjunction to the HTML changes.
